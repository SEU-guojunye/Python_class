Your program should also print out the final error achieved with both schemes, i.e. when the number of terms is $N$. Run the program with $N = 100$ and explain briefly what the graphs show."

    "## Problem 4: Fit Sines to Straight Line\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of technology, especially most types of digital audio devices for processing sound, is based on representing a signal of time as a sum of sine functions. Say the signal is some function $f(t)$ on the interval $[−\\pi, \\pi]$ (a more general interval $[a, b]$ can easily be treated, but leads to slightly more complicated formulas). Instead of working with $f(t)$ directly, we approximate $f$ by the sum\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_N(t) = \\sum^N_{n=1}b_n \\sin(nt),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the coefficients $b_n$ must be adjusted such that $S_N(t)$ is a good approximation to $f(t)$. We shall in this exercise adjust $b_n$ by a trial-and-error process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1) Make a function `sinesum(t, b)` that returns $S_N(t)$, given the coefficients $b_n$ in an array $b$ and time coordinates in an array $t$. Note that if $t$ is an array, the return value is also an array.\n",
    "- 2) Write a function `test_sinesum()` that calls `sinesum(t, b)` in 1) and determines if the function computes a test case correctly. As test case, let $t$ be an array with values $−\\pi/2$ and $\\pi/4$, choose $N = 2$, and $b_1 = 4$ and $b_2 = −3$. Compute $S_N(t)$ by hand to get reference values.\n",
    "- 3) Make a function `plot_compare(f, N, M)` that plots the original function $f(t)$ together with the sum of sines $S_N(t)$, so that the quality of the approximation $S_N(t)$ can be examined visually. The argument `f` is a Python function implementing $f(t)$, $N$ is the number of terms in the sum $S_N(t)$, and $M$ is the number of uniformly distributed $t$ coordinates used to plot $f$ and $S_N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4) Write a function `error(b, f, M)` that returns a mathematical measure of the error in $S_N(t)$ as an approximation to $f(t)$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = \\sqrt{\\sum_i(f(t_i)-S_N(t_i))^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the $t_i$ values are $M$ uniformly distributed coordinates on $[−\\pi,\\pi]$. The array $b$ holds the coefficients in $S_N$ and $f$ is a Python function implementing the mathematical function $f(t)$.\n",
    "- 5) Make a function `trial(f, N)` for interactively giving $b_n$ values and getting a plot on the screen where the resulting $S_N(t)$ is plotted together with $f(t)$. The error in the approximation should also be computed as indicated in 4). The argument `f` is a Python function for $f(t)$ and $N$ is the number of terms $N$ in the sum $S_N(t)$. The `trial` function can run a loop where the user is asked for the $b_n$ values in each pass of the loop and the corresponding plot is shown. You must find a way to terminate the loop when the experiments are over. Use $M=500$ in the calls to `plot_compare` and `error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6) Choose $f(t)$ to be a straight line $f(t) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}t$ on $[−\\pi, \\pi]$. Call `trial(f, 3)` and try to find through experimentation some values $b_1, b_2$, and $b_3$ such that the sum of sines $S_N(t)$ is a good approximation to the straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 7) Now we shall try to automate the procedure in 6). Write a function that has three nested loops over values of $b_1, b_2$, and $b_3$. Let each loop cover the interval $[−1, 1]$ in steps of 0.1. For each combination of $b_1, b_2$, and $b_3$, the error in the approximation $S_N$ should be computed. Use this to find, and print, the smallest error and the corresponding values of $b_1, b_2$, and $b_3$. Let the program also plot $f$ and the approximation $S_N$ corresponding to the smallest error.\n",
