    "\n",
    "To implement the traversing of arrays with loops and indices, is often challenging to get right. You need to understand the start, stop and step length values for the loop variable, and also how the loop variable (possibly) enters expressions inside the loop. At the same time, however, it is something that programmers do often, so it is important to develop the right skills on these matters."
